            <p>Any expansion of the TEI beyond its traditional user-base involves a recognition of
               differing views about "what text really is", and hence a rethinking of some aspects
               of TEI praxis. We report on work carried out in the context of the COST Action
               CA16204 "Distant Reading", in particular on the TEI-conformant schemas developed for
               one of the Action's principal deliverables: the European Literary Text Collection
               (ELTeC). </p>
            <p>The ELTeC will contain comparable corpora for each of a dozen European languages,
               each being a balanced sample of 100 novels from the 19th century, together with
               metadata situating them in their contexts of production and of reception. We hope
               that it will become a reliable basis for comparative work in data-driven textual
               analytics, enabling researchers to go beyond a simple "bag of words" approach, while
               respecting views of "what text really is" currently dominant in such fields as
               statistically-derived authorship attribution, topic modelling, character network
               analysis, and stylistic analysis in general. </p>
            <p>The focus of the ELTeC encoding scheme is not to represent texts in all their
               original complexity, nor to duplicate the work of scholarly editors. Instead, we aim
               to facilitate a richer and better-informed distant reading than a transcription of
               lexical content alone would permit. Where the TEI permits diversity, we enforce
               consistency, by defining encodings which permit only a specific and quite small set
               of textual features, both structural and lexical. We also define a single
               TEI-conformant way of representing the results of textual analyses such as named
               entity recognition or morphological parsing, and a specific set of metadata features.
               These constraints are expressed by a master TEI ODD, from which we derive three
               different schemas by ODD-chaining, each associated with appropriate documentation.

         <p> Comity is a term from theology or political studies, where it is used to describe the
            formal recognition by different religions, nation states, or cultures that other such
            entities have as much right to existence as themselves. In applied linguistics, the term
            has also been used by such writers as Widdowson or Aston seeking to demonstrate how the
            establishment of comity can facilitate successful inter-cultural communication, even in
            the absence of linguistic competence. We appropriate the term here in this latter sense,
            as a means of re-asserting the inter-disciplinary roots of the TEI. </p>
         <p>Recent histories of the TEI (e.g. Gavin, 2019) have a tendency to under-emphasize the
            multiplicity of disciplines gathered at its birth, preferring to focus on those
            disciplines which can be plausibly framed as prefiguring our current configuration of
            the "digital humanities" in some way. Yet the Poughkeepsie conference and the process of
            designing the Guidelines which followed alike were kickstarted by input from corpus
            linguists and computer scientists as well as traditional philologically minded editors
            and source-driven historians. The TEI belongs to a multiplicity of research communities,
            dating as it does from a period when computional linguists and traditional philogists
            alike were beginning to wake up to the implications for their disciplines of the advent
            of digital text. The steering committee which oversaw its development and the TEI
            editors alike conscientiously attempted to ensure that the Guidelines should reflect a
            view of text which was generally shared and generic, rather than specific to any
            discipline or to any particular usage model. The TEI's radical proposition that there
            was such a thing as an abstract model of textual components, which might usefully be
            considered independently of its expression in a particular source or output was
            necessarily at odds with two prevailing orthodoxies: on the one hand, the view that a
            text was no less and no more than the physical documents which instantiate it, and could
            be adequately described and represented by its salient visual properties; on the other
            hand, the view that a text was solely a linguistic phenomenon, comprising a bag of
            words, the statistical properties of which should be adequate to describe it. </p>
         <p>Old orthodoxies do not die, and it is interesting to hear some of the same arguments
            played out in different language in the different context of today's DH theorizers. But
            in our present paper, we simply want to explore the extent to which the TEI's model of
            text can be adapted to conform to a model of text derived from or constituting the "bag
            of words" orthodoxy. Our claim is that by so doing we may facilitate the enrichment of
            that model, and thus facilitate more sophisticated research into textual phenomena
            across different corpora. </p>
         <p>The context for this work is the COST Action CA16204 "Distant Reading" a principal
            deliverable of which is the European Literary Text Collection (ELTeC), a set of
            comparable corpora for each of a dozen European languages, each being a balanced sample
            of 100 novels from the 19th century, together with metadata situating them in their
            contexts of production and of reception. It is hoped that the ELTeC will become a
            reliable basis for comparative work in data-driven textual analytics and a benchmark for a particular
            written genre of considerable importance across Europe during the period between 1840 and 1920. </p>
