    <!--suggestions
   markup should ensure comparability to texts from different languages 
   and publication histories
    more on what a text is; e.g. we create a benchmark corpus for NLP / distant reading   
        this is a new perspective on using the TEI
        orientation on surface phenomena
        integrate already existing texts (refer to textgrid etc.) - re-using resources
    unique for ELTeC:
        inform about language collections: ELTeC is special in this sense that we collect also texts from languages others than English, French, German
        European picture of what a novel might be should include Romanian, Russian, Italien, Slovenian etc. languages
        stress that we do not only rely on canons - we aim to detect and encode texts that are not already in focus of DH / distant reading
   
       some information about the metadata plots as a tool for monitoring corpus building

YOu could add our cooperation with Christian Reul and OCR4 all

                <q>Those participating in conversational encounters have to have a care for the
                    preservation of good relations by promoting the other's positive self-image, by
                    avoiding offence, encouraging comity, and so on. The negotiation of meaning is
                    also a negotiation of social relations.</q>
