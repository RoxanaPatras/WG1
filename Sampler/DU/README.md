## Dutch novel chosen at random by Lou

This comes from the [Digitale Bibliotheek voor de Nederlandse Letteren](http://www.dbnl.nl/) in epub format or PDF as well as in HTML with indication of page breaks. I chose the epub version, for no very good reason. Converting it was mostly a matter of changing the name of classes in the retag.xsl stylesheet I produced for the CS epub. 

Problems: content of the  quote element representing a quoted letter is not quite right, though I am getting better at handling embedded `<br/>` elements.
