## Serbian novella from Cvetana

This came as a DOCX format file (in `Orig/Svabica.docx`) which I converted to basic TEI using my
local installation of docxtotei, generating `svabica-0.tei`. I had intended to use oxgarage for this
but the convertor there seems to throw away the highlighting I rely on to identify chapter breaks. 

I hacked a rather unsatisfactory `retag.xsl` to convert this to `svabica-1.tei`, again relying on a
crude hand edit to resolve problems caused by my ignorance of xsl-for-each-group. 

The digits following foreign phrases seem to be all that's left of links to a glossary.
