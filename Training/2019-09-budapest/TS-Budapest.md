## TS - W1 Creating ELTeC

Topic: Corpus design and text contribution for ELTeC

The aim of the Training School is to give participants hands-on
experience in creating ELTeC TEI-XML versions of source texts starting
from scanned page images or from a pre-existing HTML version. We will
supply a set of raw materials for candidates to work on, along with
detailed instructions. At the end of the Training School, each
participant should be able to contribute new TEI encoded texts to the
ELTeC GitHub repository. Participants will work in pairs with guidance
from Martina, Carolin, Christian and Lou.

On Monday, participants will learn how to use Oxygen for encoding
texts in TEI XML, and will be introduced to the sampling and balancing
criteria as well as other metadata requirements for ELTeC.  On
Tuesday, they will work with two different transformation scenarios
for creating TEI XML texts, firstly starting from page images, and
secondly starting with HTML.  We will also discuss the different
encoding levels provided for ELTeC texts, including proposals for
encoding linguistic analysis.  In the closing sessions on Wednesday,
participants will be asked to present what they have achieved, and
discuss the outcomes of this and other parallel workshops.

The Training School is intended for any researcher interested in
contributing texts to the ELTeC. Some previous experience of computer
use is needed, but no knowledge of TEI XML is assumed.
