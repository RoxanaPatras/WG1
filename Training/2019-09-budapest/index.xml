            <p>The aim of the Training School is to give participants hands-on experience in
               creating ELTeC TEI-XML versions of source texts starting from scanned page images or
               from a pre-existing HTML version. We will supply a set of raw materials for
               candidates to work on, along with detailed instructions. At the end of the Training
               School, each participant should be able to contribute new TEI encoded texts to the
               ELTeC GitHub repository. Participants will work in pairs with guidance from Martina,
               Carolin, Christian and Lou. </p>
            <p> On Monday, participants will learn how to use Oxygen for encoding texts in TEI XML,
               and will be introduced to the sampling and balance criteria as well as other metadata
               requirements for ELTeC. On Tuesday, they will work with two different transformation
               scenarios for creating TEI XML texts, firstly starting from page images, and secondly
               starting with HTML. We will also discuss the different encoding levels provided for
               ELTeC texts, including proposals for encoding linguistic analysis. In the closing
               sessions on Wednesday, participants will be asked to present what they have achieved,
               and discuss the outcomes of this and other parallel workshops. </p>
            <p> The Training School is intended for any researcher interested in contributing texts
               to the ELTeC. Some previous experience of computer use is needed, but no knowledge of
               TEI XML is assumed. </p>
