            <p>The Training School was intended to give participants hands-on experience in creating
               ELTeC TEI-XML versions of source texts starting from scanned page images or from a
               pre-existing HTML version. We supplied <ref
                  target="https://github.com/distantreading/WG1/tree/master/Training/2019-09-budapest/Work"
                  >a set of raw materials for candidates to work on</ref>, along with detailed
               instructions (see links below). At the end of the Training School, each participant
               was able to contribute new TEI encoded texts to the ELTeC GitHub
               repository.<!-- Participants will work in pairs with guidance from Martina,
               Carolin, Christian and Lou. --></p>
            <p> On Monday, participants learned how to use Oxygen for encoding texts in TEI XML, and
               were introduced to the sampling and balance criteria as well as other metadata
               requirements for ELTeC. On Tuesday, after an introduction to the principles of OCR,
               they worked with two different transformation scenarios for creating TEI XML texts,
               firstly starting from page images, and secondly starting with HTML.
               <!--We will also discuss the different encoding levels provided for
               ELTeC texts, including proposals for encoding linguistic analysis. -->In
               the closing session on Wednesday, participants presented what they had achieved, and
               discuss the outcomes of this and other parallel workshops. </p>
            <p> The Training School was intended for any researcher interested in contributing texts
               to the ELTeC. Some previous experience of computer use is needed, but no knowledge of
               TEI XML was assumed. </p>
