                <head>Over to you</head>
            <p>In this last practical session, you should test your understanding of what you've
               learned so far. We suggest you choose one or more of the following tasks <list>
                  <item>Carry on with your transcription of <title>Passages in 
                     the life...</title>. Check carefully for
                     OCR errors, using the oXygen spell checker. If you notice any systematic problems
                     (e.g. the use of asterisks), try using a regular expression to tidy them
                     up.</item>
                  <item>Try upgrading your transcription from level 0 to level 1. This will mostly
                     involve looking at the <gi>hi</gi> elements in your document and changing them
                     to more meaningful markup. To validate your document against eltec-1 instead
                     of eltec-0, you can simply edit the <code>?xml-model</code> line at the start
                     of the file. (But remember to save the document under a different name!)</item>
                  <item>Tired of 19th century britChickLit? Work on a file you scanned yesterday.
                     How many of the techniques you used today are applicable ?
                  </item><item>When you save your ELTeC files, make sure they are
                     valid.  </item>
               </list>.</p><p>At the end of the session, we'll compare notes and report
                  experience. 
               </p>
