                <head>Task</head>
                <p>The task for WG1 is to develop guidelines for data and metadata for the creation
                    of the ELTeC. This task can be split up into several distinct tasks: Guidelines
                    for corpus design, basic annotation and metadata schemes and workflow. This
                    discussion paper focuses on corpus design and metadata because both tasks
                    interplay with each other.</p>
                <p>The goal of CA16204 is to create a big benchmark corpus of literature from
                    1840-1920 (first period) for different computational distant reading methods for
                    corpus annotation and analysis. The task of creating annotation guidelines of
                    WG1 needs to be closely communicated and coordinated with WG2 in order to know
                    which methods and tools needs which kind(s) of annotation model and format. The
                    same holds for the development of the metadata scheme. </p>
                <p>For creating such a benchmark corpus, we need a corpus design which allows for a
                    comparability of texts and individual sub-collections according to different
                    metadata set(s). It should be possible for every COST Action member to sample
                    sub-collections from the ELTeC for specific tasks and research questions. In a
                    first step, we focus on the development of clear, operationalized, transparent
                    and motivated selection criteria for the corpus.</p>
                <p>It is important to stress that we do not intend to define what a novel is by
                    defining what kind of selection criteria we will use for ELTeC.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>Method</head>
                <p>We follow a non-normative but metadata-based approach of sampling criteria which
                    will follow a corpus design approach. Corpus sampling criteria are mostly
                    oriented/developed by the research question or/and contexts of the corpus
                    creators group. In CA16204, we have neither a distinct research question nor a
                    fixed and previously known corpus creator group. The research context of the
                    Action is more interested in knowledge production in a methodological sense and
                    does not prefer a single method, model or theory. Furthermore, the member group
                    of the Action will fluctuate and consist of researches from different
                    disciplines with different theoretical and cultural contexts. Thus, we need to
                    build the corpus design on a methodical basis. With this method, we will also be
                    able to select canonical texts as well but not exclusively. </p>
                <p> Representativeness is a kind of ideal which we would like to pursue but which
                    cannot be achieved as whole. We will therefore aim to represent the variety of a
                    population. In line with the MoU, the ELTeC will be designed as a monitor corpus
                    where texts (from different languages and periods) can be added over time. We
                    then need to decide which criterion is balanced in which way and interplays with
                    other criteria.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>Requirements of sampling criteria</head>
                <p>According to the MoU, the corpus design should be balanced with respect to
                    language and publication date of the texts. This means that the corpus should
                    not be based solely on chronological criteria, meaning that we need a text from
                    each year of the period in question. The main sampling criterion ‘language’ will
                    require not to include translations at all. We will take the first edition of a
                    novel or editions of these novels. By a novel, we mean the edition of the book,
                    hence excluding novels only printed in journals, unless a particular literary
                    tradition only features novels printed in serial format. If we consider editions
                    of a novel, these editions should be freely available (free licences for reusing
                    them. The first edition is more interesting from a philological point of view.
                    It represents the authentic texts of the authors. Dealing with historical texts
                    might require some cleaning up or normalizations. We will merge all word forms
                    which are seperated by line breaks. At the moment, we must assume that there are
                    no (sufficiently good) normalization tools for every language. Later editions of
                    a novel may be already normalized in some way. This might lead to different text
                    representations in ELTeC which should be indicated in the metadata. </p>
                <p>Considering also later freely available editions of a novel has two advantages:
                    First, members of the Action already can provide machine-readable text documents
                    (html, TEI etc.) of later editions and second, in some languages it might be
                    easier to find later editions which already exist in a machine-readable format
                    (in this way we do not have to put effort in digitizing them).</p>
                <p> Electronically availability should not be a leading sampling criterion althoug
                    availability is a limiting factor. A text should not be excluded from ELTeC
                    because it is not digitized, but it should be excluded if the text cannot be
                    made freely available in ELTeC. If we only use availability as a selecting
                    criterion, we are at risk of copying projects such as ‘Gutenberg’ for example.
                    The issue remains of finding additional funds to digitise non-canonical books.
                    Un til that moment, the solution would be to create pilot corpora (that can
                    later be supplemented or substituted by an alterna tive) for literatures that do
                    not have a significant number of digitized texts. </p>
                <p> We then need additional criteria which can be applied without having to know
                    (read) the texts in question. The criteria should be checked without a deep
                    knowledge about the texts. Otherwise, this will oppose the goal of the whole
                    Action and the methodical approach of distant reading. The criteria should be
                    operationalizable, meaning decidable from text metadata. Here, we define text
                    metadata in a wider scope than only the classical bibliographical metadata. In
                    this way corpus design interacts with metadata. Some of the text’s metadata can
                    be used a sampling criteria. These criteria are text-external and -internal
                    criteria (cf. Hunston 2008) on which we then need to rely. The selection
                    criteria may be assisted by bibliographical overviews (wherever availabl e) for
                    each language in order to avoid possible canon-derived bias. </p>
                <p>We suggest using an online table as a means of collecting nominations for
                    inclusion in the ELTeC but other methods are feasible. </p>
